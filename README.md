# learn-express
This repository is essentially my space to play around with and learn how to
use Node.js and Express to create a website with dynamic html generation, a
frontend and backend, as well as MongoDB database integration for querying data
and making use of schemas in the model portion of the MVC Architecture.

This was partly a class project, and partly a learning opportunity I put here
for reference.  Here's the website in action:
